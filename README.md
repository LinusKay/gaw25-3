# Game-A-Week: Week Two

> Game-a-Week is an intensive program in which participants will create 6 prototype games  — one game each week. The aim of this program is to get comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Additionally, by working on small projects with low stakes, we can open ourselves up more readily to feedback. Drawing influence from game jams, the program will prompt you with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. “time” or “black-and-white” or “one-button input”).
